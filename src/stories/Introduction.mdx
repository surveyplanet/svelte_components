# Welcome to the SurveyPlanet UI library

The SurveyPlanet UI library includes styles, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components, and patterns for various UI elements within the SurveyPlanet application. This library is intended to be used as a reference and guide those working on design and development.
