# SurveyPlanet Svelte components

A collection of Svelte components created by SurveyPlanet.

## Stories

These components are created with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Run the command bellow to get Storybook up and running.

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook
```

Once the storybook server is running open http://localhost:6006 in your browser.

## Development

Once your Storybook is server up and running you're ready to start development. All the components are located in the `src/libs` directory

## Testing

Tests are run automatically in Storybook but you can run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```
